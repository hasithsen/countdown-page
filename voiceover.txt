Hi, my name is Hasith and this is my demo for Opensource Hackfest. 

I've built a web page that displays a real-time 
countdown timer for a website that is under construction or preparing for a major launch. 

We have the HTML, styled with CSS, and JavaScript code for the countdown timer logic.

This is built in a modular manner. The JavaScript code dynamically creates the timer element inside this div.

Since this runs in the visitor's web browser, we use UTC time to ensure that the countdown is displayed correctly regardless of where the visitor is located, and we have a loop that takes care of updating the timer values for the visitors to see. 

It keeps visitors informed of the exact time until the website goes live, while offering a sleek, customizable interface.
